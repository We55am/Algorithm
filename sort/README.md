# Insertion Sort

Insertion sort is the simplest sort algorithm, it simply loop over each element in the linked list and put it in the right order with respect to the ordered ones before.

Complexity:	 **O(n<sup>2</sup>)**

# Quick Sort

Quick sort is a divide and conquer algorithm, it is more efficient in medium and large sets of data than insertion sort.
